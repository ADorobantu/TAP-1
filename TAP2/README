Exercise 1: Implement filter function in Java.
Exercise 2:  Binary Search Tree

A BSTree is a tree with two children: left one  and right one.
It must meet the property that each node of the tree contains an element that is higher than
the element on the left and lower than the element of the right branch. To insert an item
the tree you must first recursively search the position of the tree where you must insert the new data.
To find an item in the tree you also need to to search recursively the right position.

Implement methods to insert an item in the tree and a method contains (element) that tells us if
the tree containing the element. Note that element may be of any type.

1) Insert in a BSTree of Integers the following values: 5,3,6,1,4 and then search if contains 4 and 6.
Recommendation: Use Comparator<T> in the constructor if BSTree to allow comparison
between nodes of the tree.

2) Make the BSTree iterable with the new loop of JDK 1.5

3) Make another version of BSTree which will not pass the Comparator in the constructor.
Instead assume that the elements containing the tree implement the Comparable interface. 

Example Main:
 BSTree<Integer> tree = new BSTree<Integer>(new Comparaint());
 tree.insert(5);
 tree.insert(3);
 tree.insert(6);
 tree.insert(1);
 tree.insert(4);
 System.out.println(tree.contains(4));
 System.out.println(tree.contains(8));
 for (Integer elem:tree)
   System.out.println(elem);
